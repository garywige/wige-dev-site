# Contact Us Page

This page represents the most complex part of the site as of this writing. It serves as a demo of our services as well as a way that new clients can subscribe to our services. The page is mostly a reactive form, with hidden elements that appear after the form is submitted using the **ngIf** directive. Because there is private data involved, it is necessarily to involve a backend API to perform the actual sending of email data. For that reason, the form is submitted to `environment.api_url + '/v1/contactus'`, which is an API implemented in [this project](https://github.com/garywige/wige-dev-site-api). After submission, the user is entertained with a progress spinner, and then presented with a message that the form was submitted successfully, and presented with a button to go back to [home](../home).
