# App Root

This is the root of the Angular application. The main compoents of the app are:

- [Home](home)
- [Downloads](downloads)
- [Contact Us](contact-us)

You can modify the header/footer by editing the [app template](app.component.html). If you are introducing new modules into the application that are not related to Angular Material, they should be imported in the [app module](app.module.ts). Otherwise, they should be added to the [material module](material/material.module.ts).
